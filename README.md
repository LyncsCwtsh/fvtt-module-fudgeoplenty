# Fudge O' Plenty

![preview](Images/cover.jpg?raw=true)

This module works as an addon to Dice so Nice, adding more dice faces for Fudge/Fate dice to give users more customization options.

Everything this module adds is marked with a chocolate bar (🍫 <- totally fudge filled chocolate bar), so you can discern between what different DsN addons add.

You can find proper previews with examples [here](https://github.com/LyncsCwtsh/fvtt-fudgeoplenty/blob/main/Dice%20Preview.md).

### Future Plans
Currently none in the pipeline, but should inspiration strike, I might add more.

### Feedback
If you have any feedback, feel free to throw a dm in discord at me (LyncsCwtsh#7116). Doesn’t matter if it’s about requests, errors in the code or other dice related musings. Getting feedback also encourages me to figure out how Github works and wrestle with code instead of keeping creations private.
